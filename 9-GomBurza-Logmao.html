    <h1>What are most impressive event that happened during my childhood?</h1>
    
    
    <p>There are no such impressive events that happened in my childhood that I can recall, but I have a happy memorable experience from when I was <span class="highlight">9 years old</span>. We went to <span class="highlight">El Nido, Palawan</span> for our summer vacation. We stayed there for <span class="highlight">5 days</span>. We visited famous islands in El Nido, like the <span class="underline">Underground River</span>, <span class="underline">Hidden Island</span>, <span class="underline">Lulu Island</span>, and <span class="underline">Courie Island</span>. The beaches were crystal clear. We did island hopping, snorkeling, and ziplining. I wish to go back there someday and visit the famous <span class="underline">Coron Island</span>.</p>

    <p>We are not a well-off family, but I am thankful that my parents can provide us with our daily needs. I come from a very simple family where <span class="important">love and respect</span> are important. My parents sometimes have misunderstandings, but they talk about it calmly. I don't see them shouting at or hurting each other.</p>
    
    
     <h1>Challenges</h1>
     
    <p>Being in <span class="highlight">Grade 9</span> is very challenging for me. Having new teachers and classmates, I challenge myself to get good grades this year. I need to study hard and work hard for it.</p>

     <h1>Favorites</h1>
    <p>My favorite color is <span class="highlight">green</span> and I love to eat <span class="highlight">Adobo</span>. I love to play online games during my free time. I also love to play badminton with my classmates. We often hang out at one of my friends' houses and play online games together.</p>
     
     <h1>What makes me happy?</h1>
    <p>I also serve as an altar server at our church, the <span class="underline">Parish of the Risen Christ</span>. Because of this, I feel closer to God and have faith in Him. Being with my family and having good health makes me happy. Sometimes, when I have enough money, I like to go out alone to get some fresh air.</p>

      <h1>What are my plans in the future?</h1>
    <p>I want to finish my studies and become a <span class="highlight">chef</span>. I want to share my passion for cooking and open my very own restaurant for all my future customers.</p>
     
     
      <h1>Life motto</h1>
    <p>I believe in the saying, "<span class="underline">Do your best and God will do the rest</span>." I need to work hard, put my heart into the things I want to achieve, and pray to God to help me achieve those dreams and endeavors.</p>

    <p>My life may seem simple, but it is filled with love, respect, and determination. I am grateful for my family, my faith, and the opportunities I have. With hard work and God's help, I am confident that I can achieve my goals and make my dreams come true.</p>
